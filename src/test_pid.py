# PID values: Be very careful with adjustments, small adjustments make a big difference. Keep it in
#             0.1s. If it is wrong, it can cause exponential growth and cause the program to fail.
#
# Proportional: if only this is set, it will linearly approach the target velocity.
#               This is the one that should be set first.
# Integral: this makes the robot more impatient when it is slow.
#           It builds up as the error remains high for a while. Use carefully.
# Derivative: this is based on how much the error changes over time.
#             If there is a lot of oscillation, try changing this.

#
# crash: Directly set the actual velocity to a given number, 0 by default. This simulates an unexpected

#        number of seconds. Test integral windup this way.
